# ExtendedPosty
ExtendedPosty is a project built with PHP & Laravel in PHPStorm IDE. It is based on Traversy Media tutorial (https://youtu.be/MFh0Fd7BsjE) but It is extended. 
I added new functions such as editing posts or some new, better colours. Also this application uses MySQL Database. With this changes this project is ready to use. 


## What do You need to run?
Project needs MySQL database. Also project lacks mailing service credentials. I have used Mailtrap.io.
